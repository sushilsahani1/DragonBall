            <h1>Master Roshi</h1>
            <p>
                Master Roshi (武む天てん老ろう師し Muten Rōshi, lit. "Old Heavenly Martial Arts Master"), also known as the Turtle
                Hermit (亀かめ仙せん人にん Kame Sen'nin) (or Turtle ( Kame)[6] in his youth) and God of Martial Arts (武道の神様 Budō
                no Kami-sama), is a perverted hermit and a master of martial arts. He lives on his own isolated island
                called Kame House, where he may be willing to train students who travel to his doorstep. He is also the
                originator of the Kamehameha Wave.

                Despite his lecherous tendencies and his old age, Roshi is an extremely respected and capable warrior,
                serving as the master of Gohan, Ox-King, Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha. His drive to push his students to
                new heights and support them on their martial arts journeys makes him one of the most notable supporting
                characters in the series.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Master Roshi is bald, with a thick white fu manchu mustache and beard. He is almost always seen wearing
                his trademark sunglasses; sometime later Master Roshi left his old sunglasses and began to wear more
                futuristic ones. He wears beach clothes or a martial arts suit and a Turtle Shell on his back. He
                usually wields a walking stick. His bust, waist and hip measurement are all 73cm.[7] When disguised as
                Jackie Chun, Master Roshi glues a wig of white hair onto his head.

                In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, Master Roshi wears a pink shirt and white shorts with flip flops. In
                Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, Master Roshi wears a white tank top and green flip flops.

                When he was a teenager while training under Master Mutaito and Korin, it is shown that he had black hair
                and wore a black pair of sunglasses along with a bluish-purple Qipao style martial arts uniform. He was
                also noted by Bulma to be very handsome, shocked to see how Roshi turned out in old age. During the King
                Piccolo wars, his head was shaven, and he wore a purple Mutaito Training Academy Gi like the rest of
                Mutaito's students at the time including Master Shen. He also did not wear any sunglasses during this
                time.
            </p>
            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <p>
                Master Roshi is over three hundred years old at the start of the series and provides various stories to
                explain his longevity. Roshi enjoys eating home delivered pizza,[3] which serves as a tongue-in-cheek
                joke because Roshi lives so far out into the ocean. He also enjoys reading, watching TV, using the
                internet (mainly for adult sites), playing video games and taking afternoon naps.[3] He is a very
                lecherous pervert who constantly watches Wide-Thigh Aerobics on television or looks at Dirty Magazines
                in his spare time. He even accepts a bribe from Bulma to show him her panties in exchange for a Dragon
                Ball early in the series (and got a very big surprise, as Bulma unknowingly was not wearing any panties
                when she exposed herself).

            <h1>Bulma</h1>
            <p>
                ​Bulma (ブルマ Buruma, lit. "Blooma") is a brilliant scientist and the second daughter of Capsule
                Corporation's founder Dr. Brief and his wife Bikini,[12] the younger sister of Tights,[13] and is Goku's
                first friend.[1][2] She used to be the girlfriend of Yamcha,[14][15] but moved on (while remaining
                friends with him) and, eventually, became the wife of Vegeta, as well as the mother of Trunks and Bulla.
                A technological and scientific genius who can turn her talents to almost any field and understand alien
                technology near-effortlessly, her inventions, and the resources of Capsule Corporation, have been
                invaluable to Goku and the rest of the Dragon Team many times. Her most notable invention is the Dragon
                Radar.

                Bulma is the most significant female character in the series. Aside from Goku, Bulma is the single
                longest-running character in the entire meta-series, being introduced in the first Dragon Ball chapter
                and episode and maintaining a prominent role until the end of the series.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the entire series, Bulma has changed her appearance more than any character going through a
                total of 18 different hairstyles. Her hair colors varies between appearances, being colored: purple,
                blue, or turquoise. Her hairstyle was shoulder-length as a teenager. Many of the clothes Bulma is seen
                wearing often bear her name or the Capsule Corporation logo on it.

                She had a tender appearance in her teen years, like her milky colored skin. In her teen years her bust
                measurement was 85cm, her waist measurement was 58cm, and her hip measurement was 84cm.[7] As an adult
                her bust measurement was 87.2cm before breastfeeding, and 83.4cm after.[17]
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Bulma has a temperamental personality while being very tomboyish and girly at the same time. While known
                for her extreme intellect, Bulma is considerably spoiled and vain, using her great beauty as an excuse
                for her selfish behavior. Her selfishness prevented her from being able to ride the Flying Nimbus. While
                in stressful conditions, she becomes frightened easily and gets angry toward everyone including her
                allies. Bulma tends to have a great deal of concern over her hygiene, frequently complaining when
                circumstances prevent her from taking a bubble bath or replenishing her beauty supplies, even when her
                hygiene is the least of her worries such as being stranded in the wilderness.

            <h1>Mr. Satan</h1>
            <p>
                Mr. Satan (ミスター・サタン Misutā Satan), also known as Hercule Satan in the Funimation dub, is the World
                Martial Arts Champion and the Earth's protector. His real name is Mark (マーク Māku).
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Mr. Satan is a tall man of a rather muscular and hairy physique and tends to adopt an imposing
                appearance when seen in public. His black curly Afro, mustache, and well-trimmed sideburns are among his
                most recognizable traits, as well as his cleft chin. Mr. Satan typically is seen in his martial arts
                uniform or in fitted suits, but has been known to wear more luxurious clothing when resting or making
                public appearances. His gi is often accented with either a red or white cape depending on which gi he
                dons, and his notably hairy chest and arms are usually displayed openly.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                During the Dragon Ball Z time period, Mr. Satan is the reigning World Martial Arts Champion, a title won
                fairly by beating other normal earthlings in a time when Goku and other powerful fighters were battling
                on Namek and later against the Androids.[6] During the time of the Cell Games, Mr. Satan was already
                rich and famous, but also an egomaniac. He boasted endlessly on television about his strength, and that
                he was the "best fighter in the world." In the eyes of characters who know otherwise, he is considered
                to be a showboating blowhard.

            <h1>Videl</h1>
            <p>
                Videl (ビーデル Bīderu) is the daughter of Mr. Satan and Miguel, the wife of Gohan and the mother of Pan.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                idel is a beautiful fair-skinned (pale-skinned color in the anime series) young child and young woman of
                very slim figure build and below average height with straight black hair that has side bangs with five
                loose short strands over her forehead, light-blue eyes and a slender frame yet athletic physique.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, Videl is a headstrong, independent, fierce, tough and tomboyish girl who was raised with fame
                all around her where she is also feisty and stubborn, much like Chi-Chi. Videl is quite perceptive as
                she had doubts about her father's claims of defeating Cell and correctly deduced that Gohan was both the
                mysterious "Golden Fighter" and Great Saiyaman, as well as ultimately coming to suspect that Gohan was
                the boy who fought Cell Games. She was also crafty enough to get Gohan to accidentally reveal he was
                Great Saiyaman, which she uses to blackmail him. She is also a competitive fighter as she blackmailed
                Gohan in order to get him to enter the tournament as she wanted to fight him after seeing his abilities
                and deduced he was the son of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament champion due to sharing the same
                surname, though she also demanded he teach her how to fly to ensure it would be a fair fight, which also
                shows she was not fooled by her father's claims that such techniques were simple tricks.

            <h1>Trunks</h1>
            <p>
                Trunks (トランクス Torankusu) is a Human-type Earthling/Saiyan hybrid, the firstborn child and only son of
                Vegeta and Bulma[5][6] and the elder brother of Bulla.[7]
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Trunks has either blue[8][9][10] or lavender hair color and his mother's blue eyes. He has his father's
                eye shape, facial features and tanned skin. Several characters, such as Goku, Krillin and Bulma, remark
                how much Trunks resembles Vegeta. For the majority of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green
                gi, an orange belt, orange wristbands and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears
                this in the movie, Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming, Trunks wears a light green long
                sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his
                golden boots from his primary outfit.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                As a child during the Majin Buu arc, Trunks is shown to be quite cocky and stingy just like his father,
                as well as mischievous, most likely due to the fact that this Trunks grew up with his father Vegeta and
                enjoyed the luxuries of peace, while Future Trunks grew up without Future Vegeta and in an apocalyptic
                world, causing him to be much more serious and cautious.[11] Due to being the heir to Capsule
                Corporation and being pampered by his family, Trunks grows up to be a spoiled child. Trunks has a
                combination of both of his parents' personalities: cocky and proud like his father and spoiled and
                selfish like his mother. He refuses to respect someone he does not like, another trait he shares with
                his father. This is shown when he disrespects Goku when they first meet, as Trunks believes he is not as
                strong as his father and again when he wondered why he wasn't present when his father was killed. Later
                on, Trunks does gain more respect for Goku after seeing Goku's Super Saiyan 3 power in action when
                holding off Majin Buu. He is shown to be loving towards his parents and grandparents and will not think
                twice about defending his family. Trunks is very loyal towards his father and thinks highly of him
                despite his flaws, though this is in part due to Trunks knowing nothing about Vegeta's past as a former
                enemy, and being ignorant of Vegeta's personal conflict over whether his family or superiority was more
                important. For example, when Trunks learned of Vegeta's death in the Majin Buu Saga, Trunks blamed Goku
                for being unconscious at the time, even though Piccolo tried to reveal it was Vegeta responsible for
                that and allowing Majin Buu's revival before Goku stopped him from doing so.

            <h1>Goten</h1>
            <p>
                Son Goten (孫そん悟ご天てん Son Goten, Japanese pronunciation: [sõŋgotẽ̞ɴ]) is the youngest son of Goku and his
                wife Chi-Chi, making him a Saiyan and Earthling hybrid. Goten is Gohan's younger brother and Trunks'
                best friend.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Goten's appearance as a child is a spitting image of Goku's childhood look, including messy, unkempt
                hair, same eye color, lighter-pale complexion and a playful face. He also wears an orange gi similar to
                Goku's, minus the kame symbol, along with a dark blue long-sleeved undershirt and black training shoes
                with dark blue shin guards in the Majin Buu Arc. Goten is known for looking almost identical to his
                father as a child, to the point when Goku first meets Goten he proclaims "I think there is a little me
                hiding behind your leg Chi-Chi!" This resemblance to his father is pointed out numerous times by other
                characters throughout the series, as well as in a few video games. His appearance drastically changes as
                he grows older, towards the end of Dragon Ball Z. Goten's hair grew, so that he would not be mistaken
                for Goku and is seen with a shaggier hairstyle similar to Yamcha and also wears an orange gi similar to
                what Pan wears at the World Martial Arts Tournament.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                As a child, Goten is a fun-loving and kind-hearted person like his father. However, thanks to his
                mother's structured upbringing, he tends to show more common sense and proper manners than his father
                did as a child (even in some cases as an adult). While still being forced to study hard like his older
                brother by their mother, having mellowed out following Goku's death, Chi-Chi allowed Goten to have more
                freedom to explore his own interests than Gohan did growing up; Chi-Chi even took it upon herself to
                train Goten in the martial arts. This allowed him to develop love for play-fighting and bug catching.[
