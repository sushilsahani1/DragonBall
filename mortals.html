            <h1>Goku</h1>
            <p>Son Goku (孫そん悟ご空くう Son Gokū, Japanese pronunciation: [sõŋgokɯː]), born Kakarot (カカロット Kakarotto, Japanese
                pronunciation: [kakaɾot̚to]), is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the overall main protagonist of the Dragon
                Ball series. Originally was sent to Earth as an infant, Kakarot would be adopted by Grandpa Gohan who
                named him Son Goku. A head injury at an early age alters Goku's memory, ridding him of his initial
                destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. He
                constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and the
                universe safe from destruction many times.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearnce</h2>
            <p>Goku looks almost exactly like his father, possessing the same spiky black hairstyle, dark-colored eyes,
                and facial features. However, he has softer eyes, a kind demeanor, and a lighter-pale skin complexion
                from his mother. Goku's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his hair. He has three bangs
                hanging to the right of his forehead and two bangs hanging to the left. His hair also stands up in the
                front with four spikes and three bangs in the back (later in the anime, he has five spikes in the front
                and four in the back). Goku was born with the signature tail of the Universe 7 Saiyans, which was long
                and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrown multiple times in his early childhood, but in
                his late teens, Goku's tail was permanently removed by Kami in order to prevent his Great Ape
                transformation.

                At age 12, Goku was rather short and appeared even younger than he was, being considered less than 10
                years old (people were surprised when learning his actual age). His somewhat simple-minded personality
                also gave people the impression that he was as young as he looked. During the next few years, Goku did
                not go through any physical changes, other than his muscles becoming more pronounced. By age 15, he
                began showing noticeable increases in height. By age 18, he had a considerable growth spurt, growing
                taller than some of his friends and developing a well-built physique. He is also considered very
                handsome, as noted by various women including Bulma and Heles. His physical changes made him almost
                indistinguishable from before and was only recognized by his signature naïve personality and "trademark"
                hairstyle. By age 25, Goku had another growth spurt, and became about similar in height to his taller
                human allies and much more muscular.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Originally as an infant Saiyan, Goku was very timid, constantly crying for attention. Goku was then
                programmed with intense hostility to carry out his mission of eradicating all sentient life on Earth.
                When found by Grandpa Gohan, he was unruly, savage, and aggressive, wanting nothing to do with the
                elder. However, after the head injury that caused him to lose his instinctual aggression, Goku became
                well-known for the energetic, kindhearted, pure heart and caring personality traits he inherited from
                his mother Gine. He was taught to be compassionate and respectful to others by Grandpa Gohan. He takes
                most situations in stride; he rarely lets things get him worked up; he quickly got over losing his tail
                each time. He is however not without fear. Goku is shown to be submissive to overbearing women like
                Bulma and Chi-Chi, even to the point of Master Roshi jokingly declaring that for all his immense power,
                he is terrified of his wife. In the anime, he also has aichmophobia, a crippling fear of needles. He is
                not beyond feeling sorrow, most noticeably seen from the loss of his grandfather. In the Dragon Ball
                Super manga, he is not above feeling shame, as he regrets his lack of maturity as a person despite all
                the teachers who have helped him and likewise wants to make his loved-ones proud of him. He also shows
                genuine concern for the well-being of those close to him. When Master Roshi seemingly died against
                Ganos, Goku frantically rushed to his aid, desperate to save his mentor and shed tears of joy when he
                managed to revive him.

                He is well-noted for his love of any food, even by Saiyan standards,[4] which can be comical at times.
                When hypnotized while facing "Jackie Chun", Bulma told Goku dinner was ready, instantly waking him
                up.[34] Like most Saiyans, Goku loves combat and to challenge strong opponents. As such, Goku rarely
                shows nervousness or fear when fighting. While not arrogant in his abilities (especially compared to
                Vegeta), Goku has a tendency to be too relaxed and recklessly challenge anyone he views as strong to a
                fight. Despite his fighting spirit, he is, at heart, a pacifist, as he often spares his enemies, trying
                to avoid hurting or even killing people if possible and never using more strength than
                necessary.[35][36] He also strongly believes that people can change for the better, as he spared
                Piccolo, as well as Vegeta, in their respective fights, despite the former wanting to kill him and the
                latter killing most of Goku's allies. This, combined with his naturally gentle nature, can lead to him
                letting his guard down.</p>

            <h1>Vegeta</h1>
            <p>Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta), more specifically Vegeta IV (ベジータ四世 Bejīta Yonsei),[7] recognized as Prince Vegeta
                (ベジータ王子 Bejīta Ōji) is the prince of the fallen Saiyan race and the husband of Bulma, the father of
                Trunks and Bulla, the eldest son of King Vegeta, as well as one of the main characters of the Dragon
                Ball series.
            </p>

            <p>Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright
                killer,[8] but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth.
                He would later repeatedly fight alongside Universe 7's most powerful warriors in order to protect Earth
                and his family, as well as to surpass Goku in power.[9]
            </p>

            <p>Vegeta's character development is the most praised and one of the biggest in the series. He started off
                serving as the main antagonist of the Vegeta Saga, but then as an anti-heroic tritagonist throughout the
                rest of Dragon Ball Z. After the Majin Buu Saga Vegeta would evolve into a hero as the main
                deuteragonist/secondary protagonist of the sequel series, Dragon Ball Super.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Vegeta is a small yet very well-built man of a below-average stature, standing at 164 centimeters tall.
                His hair is black (or dark reddish brown, depending on the media) and spikes upwards. Vegeta has a
                prominent widow's peak. Like most Saiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a consistently stern look to
                them. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile brown-furred tail, until it was
                permanently cut off by Yajirobe.

                Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very
                short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat taller
                and noticeably more muscular. His hair and forehead appear to be shorter and his facial features, which
                are perpetually in a scowl, also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making
                him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in his debut.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Vegeta is arrogant throughout the series and becomes bitter due to the abuse his race suffered at the
                hands of Frieza. Following the destruction of his homeworld Planet Vegeta, his hatred toward Frieza
                grows. His royalty seems to have bestowed upon him an inflated sense of superiority, holding himself
                above nearly everyone he encounters. He is immensely proud of his Saiyan heritage and believes his race
                to be the most powerful in the universe. Despite this, even as an antagonist, he did not act as an
                ordinary Saiyan, being even crueler and prideful thanks to Frieza's influence.

                As the prince of a demolished Planet Vegeta, Vegeta is initially introduced as an unrepentant villain.
                Judging from his evil intentions before joining the Z Fighters, Vegeta has been consistently
                characterized as extremely arrogant, vengeful, and at times, sadistic. Many of Vegeta's early heroic
                acts are because of self-interest or revenge, although he later settles down and mellows out, adjusting
                to Earth as his home, raising a family with Bulma. Having been born into the upper tier of Saiyan
                society, Vegeta was fixated on achieving the legendary status of Super Saiyan and becoming the most
                powerful warrior in the universe. Vegeta is more of a tactical fighter who often rushes in the brawl
                without hesitation. However, his rage or arrogance often causes him to underestimate his opponent and
                usually leads to his eventual defeat and sometimes death. His royal blood and intense fighting style
                have both benefited and harmed him in many battles.

            <h1>Gohan</h1>
            <p>
                Son Gohan (孫そん悟ご飯はん Son Gohan, Japanese pronunciation: [sõŋgohãɴ]) is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the
                most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary
                protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the eldest nephew of Raditz, the older brother of Goten, the
                husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.

                Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for fighting (although, he does possess a strong power within
                him) and prefers to do so only when his loved ones are threatened.[6] Nevertheless, Gohan fights
                alongside the Dragon Team in the defense of Earth for much of his life.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Gohan resembles his father, inheriting Goku's hair, facial features, and dark eyes. At the same time, he
                has his mother's light peach complexion rather than his father's light tan. Also taking after his
                father, Gohan inherited a Saiyan tail, which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and
                regrew a few times during his childhood until removed permanently by Vegeta in their first battle.

                When first introduced as a young child, he had short and spiky but relatively well-kept hair. He wore a
                white sleeveless shirt and green pants with black boots with white lacing, this outfit was covered in a
                Hanfu-style top that was yellow with green sleeves and on the front his family name, 'Son', written in
                kanji within a large white circle with black lining. He also wore a red cap with the Four-Star Dragon
                Ball attached to the top. He later removes the Hanfu-style top to show his outfit when he is ready to
                train with Piccolo.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                As a child, Gohan was a shy, studious, intellectual child who lacked a Saiyan's raw fighting spirit, so
                he had to utilize his incredible half-breed Saiyan potential and emotional reserves to protect those he
                loves. As an adult, he achieves his dream career of becoming a great scholar.

                Being only half-Saiyan, Gohan is unusual in his values and personality compared to most full-blooded
                Saiyans in regards to the fact that he does not derive much pleasure from combat. However, when he is
                forced to fight, he shows special interest in protecting his family and friends. Like his father, Gohan
                has a pure and gentle heart, as well as possessing the typical Saiyan appetite that will compel to eat
                anything.[3]

                While he claims he does not share the love of fighting Goku has, Gohan does indeed love martial arts and
                adventures. It is also clearly obvious that he enjoys his superhuman powers, especially when utilizing
                them as a superhero. However, he dislikes receiving the fame and attention that comes with it and
                prefers to keep a low profile, which is why he created the Great Saiyaman persona, in order to keep his
                identity a secret. This is even more evident when he didn't acknowledge Cell's defeat at his hands to
                the public after Mr. Satan falsely took credibility for it. During the Zeno Expo, he admitted that his
                Saiyan half was getting excited from the challenge shown by Top of Universe 11, demonstrating that even
                though he despises senseless violence, he actually does enjoy fighting as a sport. It is possible that
                he prefers not to fight due to the many gruesome and painful battles he experienced in the past as a
                child, which may have led Gohan to have negative emotions associated with fighting.

            <h1>Piccolo</h1>
            <p>
                Piccolo Jr. (ピッコロ・ジュニア Pikkoro Junia, lit. "Piccolo Junior"), usually just called Piccolo or Kamiccolo
                and also known as Ma Junior (マジュニア Ma Junia), is a Namekian and also the final child and reincarnation
                of King Piccolo, later becoming the reunification of the Nameless Namekian after fusing with Kami.
                According to Grand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part of the Dragon Clan,
                who were the original creators of the Dragon Balls.

                A wise and cunning warrior, he was the main antagonist in the final saga of Dragon Ball, the Piccolo Jr.
                Saga, and was thus a ruthless enemy of Goku. However, starting with the first saga of Dragon Ball Z, the
                Raditz Saga, he began to lose all villainous traits, and when he started training Goku's son Gohan
                during the Vegeta Saga which led to the two developing a strong bond with each other, he became a
                permanent member of the Dragon Team and eventually one of Earth's greatest heroes.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Piccolo is a very tall and muscular Namekian. While greatly resembling his father/incarnation, he is
                noticeably shorter and somewhat thinner. He also has a more solid facial structure with less pronounced
                cheekbones, a rounder chin, and a straight nose. Piccolo only has four fingers with black nails in the
                Dragon Ball manga, but five fingers with white nails in the anime series and the Dragon Ball Super
                manga. He has several patches on his arms which are pink in the anime and yellow in the manga (and in
                the film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero).

                Piccolo Jr.'s outfit when he was a kid is very similar to the one King Piccolo is first seen wearing,
                with the same color scheme shown on the Kanzenban manga covers. From the time he is a young adult
                onward, Piccolo wears a dark purplish-blue gi, pointy orange shoes and sky blue obi (red in the manga).
                When not fighting seriously, Piccolo also wears a white turban with a dark purplish-blue top and a white
                cape along with it.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the franchise, regardless of Piccolo's allegiance, his general demeanor has always been
                stern, if not grumpy, with an indifferent attitude towards others. Piccolo rarely smiles and enjoys
                solitude. Piccolo is frequently seen meditating in quiet places and drinking thawed ice water in the
                north area.[3] However, he shows a noticeable cockiness when fighting. He can also be very
                confrontational toward people, showing very direct and honest opinions about a situation or an
                individual. Piccolo is known for his very precise and efficient methods in battle and likewise is shown
                to be very analytical and tactical in battle, able to see through his opponent's skills and weaknesses
                to devise effective strategies for victory. In the Baby Saga, Baby openly acknowledged Piccolo as one of
                the most brilliant fighters in the galaxy.

            <h1>Buu</h1>
            <p>
                Good Buu (魔ま人じんブウ（善ぜん） Majin Bū (Zen), lit. "Demon Person Boo (Good)"),[4] also known mainly as Majin
                Buu, is the result of the Innocent Buu using fission to split into good and evil halves. He would go on
                to become a member of the Z Fighters and live with Mr. Satan. After the battle against the pure Majin
                Buu, Buu is referred to as Buu instead of Majin Buu and to the world he becomes Mr. Buu.

                Good Buu possesses the Grand Supreme Kai (大だい界かい王おう神しん Dai Kaiōshin, lit. "Great God of the Kings of the
                Worlds*) as part of his being and eventually temporarily awakened this part of himself.
            </p>
            <h2>Traits</h2>
            <p>
                Due to Innocent Buu splitting into Good Buu and Evil Buu, Good Buu became a "different life-form"[10]
                from the original Kid Buu and Innocent Buu forms and lost many of the unique capabilities of the
                original Majin.

                He became an entity of pure good, due to Innocent Buu's evil manifesting as Evil Buu, he lost the
                ability to absorb using his body and needed to turn others into chocolate in order to accomplish an
                "absorption" and he no longer needed to hibernate for incredibly long periods of time - instead entering
                an unwaking sleep for a brief period of time. Upon his initial appearance he also lost his ability to
                power up through anger (as Evil Buu was the embodiment of Buu's wrath), but later regained it after
                being spat out by Kid Buu.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Good Buu is an entity of pure good, and is very kind, caring, and playful. Once he was absorbed by Evil
                Buu, his playful and childish traits manifest in Super Buu and Kid Buu respectively. During his second
                battle against Gotenks, Gotenks was preparing the Super Ghosts of his Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack for
                battle. Piccolo showed Gotenks that Buu had already regenerated from the last Super Ghost attack. Super
                Buu was also lying on his stomach, drinking a soda (though it looked like a milkshake) and reading a
                magazine, much to Gotenks' fury and embarrassment. Also, when Goku and Vegeta were preparing for battle,
                Kid Buu was sleeping (as Buu only needs a little time to rest), much to Goku's surprise. More
                importantly, due to his connection with Mr. Satan he had influence to stop him from killing the former
                as Super Buu and later Kid Buu. For this reason, he also responded to Videl's request to be patient due
                to being Mr. Satan's daughter; though it wasn't enough to stop him from killing her. While mildly
                annoying to Super Buu, it infuriated Kid Buu enough that he spat him out as soon as he was able to.
                Despite his good nature, it is shown in Dragon Ball Super that when he is hungry, Good Buu can be foul
                tempered and grumpy like when he interrupted Mr. Satan's press conference and is also shown to be quite
                gluttonous as he selfishly refused to share one of his pudding cups with Beerus. He also gets angry much
                like his original counterparts especially when loved ones are hurt or dead, such as Mr. Satan. However,
                these negative traits could be attributed to his childlike personality. Similarly, he also tends to do a
                lot more than is necessary for a given task largely due to his childlike personality. This is especially
                evident by his supplying an ice cream store a huge amount of Zeni (the store owner's reaction implied it
                was significantly more than needed to buy the ice cream) to walk off with a large ice cream cone.

            <h1>Yamcha</h1>
            <p>
                Yamcha (ヤムチャ Yamucha) is a major deuteragonist in the Dragon Ball manga and in the anime Dragon Ball,
                and later a supporting tritagonist in Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, with a few appearances in
                Dragon Ball GT. He is a former boyfriend of Bulma and the lifelong best friend of Puar.

                A former desert bandit, Yamcha was once an enemy of Goku, but quickly reformed and became a friend and
                ally.[13] Brave, boastful and dependable, Yamcha is a very talented martial artist and one of the most
                powerful humans on Earth, possessing skills and traits that allow him to fight alongside his fellow Z
                Fighters when major threats loom. Although he retired by the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, due to being
                largely outclassed by both his allies (namely the Saiyans) and their enemies, he is always present
                whenever a new threat approaches, and will occasionally lend a helping hand, thus proving himself to be
                a powerful ally in his own right.[14

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Yamcha's appearance changes throughout the series, mainly his clothes and hairstyle.[15][16] Yamcha
                started out the series with long hair and bangs. After settling down in the city, he cut his hair to fit
                in. Later on, he would grow his hair out again and eventually cut short to a spikier hairstyle and
                completely short before growing his hair out once again. Several of Yamcha's hairstyles are also used by
                Gohan at various points in his life.[17] Another of Yamcha's most significant appearance changes were
                the mysterious scars he got sometime during his three years training for the 23rd World Martial Arts
                Tournament. According to Android 19's scanner, Yamcha is 183 centimeters tall and weighs 68 kilograms
                during the Androids Saga.[6] The first kanji Yamcha has on his clothes 楽 (raku) stands for "comfort" or
                "easy"; there is no real meaning behind it other than he just enjoys being comfortable.[18] After
                training with Master Roshi, he takes the "turtle" or "Kame" kanji "亀" as a sign of respect. Later, after
                training with King Kai, he wears both "Kame and "Kai" kanji. He wears them the opposite way Goku did
                ("Kame" on the back and "Kai" on the chest), except in Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might where he wears
                the "Kai" kanji on the back and "Kame" on the chest.[19]
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Yamcha is originally characterized as a deadly warrior, who fears nothing but talking to women. After
                befriending Goku and the others, his personality remains mostly the same, but becomes very caring and
                considerate of the people he protects. He is showcased as a courageous warrior who strives to be the
                best, but is unable to reach this status, a fact that appears to plague him. He has a great network of
                information, recognizing Goku's Power Pole as Grandpa Gohan's during their first fight.

                Yamcha is a huge fan of the World Martial Arts Tournament and has always wanted to compete and someday
                win.[22] It is likely this is why he has knowledge of famous fighters like Grandpa Gohan, Monster
                Carrot, Bacterian and King Chappa. Whenever the tournament date neared, Yamcha would always go through
                vigorous training and invent a new technique like the Blinding Wolf Fang Fist, Neo Wolf Fang Fist and
                the Spirit Ball. He is the second fighter to learn the Kamehameha since the beginning of Dragon Ball
                (after Goku).
