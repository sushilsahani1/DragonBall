            <h1>Zeno</h1>
            <p>Grand Zeno (全王 Zen’ō, lit. "King of All"), the Omni-King, is the supreme ruler of all the Multiverse
                and seemingly its most powerful being. Since the events of the "Future" Trunks Saga, Zeno co-rules
                jointly with his future counterpart.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Zeno is very short and small, with a rather large oval-shaped head. He primarily has sky blue skin,
                except for two sections from his ears to the middle of each eye on both sides of his head, which are
                purple. He has small round eyes, and small rounded grey "ears". His main attire is a magenta and yellow
                lined coat, with yellow pants and magenta shoes. He wears a black and white shirt underneath, with the
                kanji for "all" (全) on the front. He typically has a blank expression on his face.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Like many deities, such as the angels, Zeno seems to have a general indifference about life, as well as
                all the other stuff within the multiverse, having destroyed six of the eighteen universes after a bout
                of anger, and also destroying several planets in a game he played with his future self 202 times. In the
                manga version of the Universe Survival Saga, however, it is implied by Grand Minister that the real
                reason why he destroyed the aforementioned six universes was simply to get rid of what he felt were too
                many universes. He apparently wished to decrease that number further for some time, giving no excuses
                for such a decision beyond saying 12 universes are a bit too much to keep track of, with the Tournament
                of Power being the perfect opportunity to do so. Even more, this indifference seems to extend to the
                gods themselves, seemingly rendering him a remorseless being to his peers, and was shown to not even be
                affected by Roh's horrified crying out of his name. He also shows some degree of sadism, as shortly
                after erasing Universe 9, he proceeded alongside his future counterpart to say "bye-bye!" in a joking
                tone, as well as being heard laughing childishly while erasing the universe. He and his counterpart also
                said "squish" in a light-hearted, delighted tone when they were erasing Universe 3. Furthermore, he
                seems to be incapable of understanding the horrible action of erasing trillions of lives, since he and
                his future counterpart wonder why everyone in the Tournament of Power stops fighting after witnessing an
                entire universe getting erased.

            <h1>Whis</h1>
            <p>Whis (ウイス Uisu) is the Guide Angel Attendant of Universe 7's God of Destruction, Beerus, as well as
                his martial arts teacher. Along with the other angels, he is a child of the Grand Minister. Like all
                attendants, he is bound to the service of his deity and usually does not leave Beerus unaccompanied.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Whis is a tall, thin humanoid with pale blue skin, white hair, violet eyes, and rather effeminate
                features. He owns a long scepter with a gem that floats above it, and is usually seen holding it in his
                right hand. Around his neck is a large light blue ring. Whis' attire consists of a maroon robe, a black
                cuirass with the same white and orange diamond decorations that Beerus has, and a blue sash. He also
                wears black high-heeled shoes with long toes resembling winklepickers with white spats.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Whis has a calm, aloof, peaceful personality, but is absent-minded with a somewhat effeminate nature at
                times. Very eccentric, his priorities can often seem exceedingly trivial.[8] He remains calm even when
                his student, Beerus, goes into fits of extreme rage, but can become irritated if Beerus goes too far,
                but food will calm him down. A very insightful and carefree individual, he rarely gets worked up or
                surprised by anything not directly involving Beerus, such as being impressed by Hit's Time-Skip and
                Goku's Kaio-ken respectively. He apparently is also a very proud teacher, as upon seeing Goku seemingly
                master Ultra Instinct, Whis was overjoyed at Goku learning from his lessons. Despite his carefree
                nature, he is not without fear, as he became very nervous when Zeno wanted to meet with Goku, albeit
                this is understandable when the situation involves the Omni-King. He also became somewhat exasperated
                with Goku's behavior towards the Grand Minister and Zeno, even showing bafflement when Goku gave Zeno
                his nickname. He is shown to be very well-mannered, always speaking and behaving respectfully to all
                around him. Likewise, he also dislikes poor table manners, negatively commenting on Beerus' sloppy
                eating when visiting a planet.

            <h1>Beerus</h1>
            <p>Beerus (ビルス Birusu) is the God of Destruction of Universe 7. He is accompanied by his martial
                arts teacher and attendant, Whis. Beerus' twin brother is Champa, the God of Destruction of
                Universe 6.

                Beerus is the main antagonist of the Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods film and the God of
                Destruction Beerus Saga but becomes a supporting character in later sagas.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Beerus is a purple anthropomorphic cat with golden yellow eyes and large pointed ears. His
                form is hairless and while overall defined inbuilt, he is very thin and bony. He is of a similar
                height to Goku, being slightly shorter, but his ears make him appear taller. He dons black,
                blue, and gold Egyptian-looking attire with the same white and orange diamond decorations as
                his mentor Whis.

                In the "Super Star Guide's" minicomic teasing Champa's appearance and his resemblance to Beerus,
                Beerus appears wearing Champa's clothing, and also being inflated by Whis to appear identical to Champa.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Beerus is powerful, yet lazy and playful (like most cats). His similarities
                to cat-like behavior also display in his love for long sleep sessions and
                how he grooms himself. Beerus is always in a bad mood when he wakes up
                from his deep slumber but becomes less grumpy the more awake he is.
                Similar to many cats, he likes to display dominance and will claim
                whatever he desires to have without much consideration for how it will
                affect others. He is also a gourmet, and his planet is stocked with
                fish and other sorts of food.[10] While he is a fearsome god, his
                cat-like gestures and his variety of facial expressions separate him
                from the more malevolent antagonists in the series.[11] He has a very
                indifferent behavior toward death, being the God of Destruction, and
                cares little to none about death and the billions, possibly trillions
                of lives he has taken over the years he has been the God of Destruction.
                He often uses the threat of destroying Earth as a means to get what he
                wants or as a simple warning to Whis and the other Z fighters.

            <h1>Champa</h1>
            <p>Champa (シャンパ Shanpa)[3] is the God of Destruction of Universe 6 and rival and to his twin brother
                Beerus, the God of Destruction of twin universe 7. He is accompanied by his attendant and martial arts
                teacher, Vados.

                Champa is the main antagonist of the Universe 6 Saga, but he becomes a supporting character in later
                sagas.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Champa's a purple cat-like humanoid, similar to Beerus, but with a plumper build contrasting Beerus
                and likewise a much shorter tail. He wears clothing which resembles that of the ancient Egyptian
                royalty like Beerus, complete with a red and pink collar with white linings on both edges,
                corresponding with Vados, his attendant. Unlike Beerus and Whis, Champa and Vados have circles
                on their collars and sashes instead of diamonds. He wears golden bangles and arm rings, as well as
                an earring, which was pierced in his right ear unlike his twin, who wears it on his left, which is
                depicted in the anime.

                It was implied by Vados that Champa was once leaner than his current build but later gained more weight.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Much like his brother, Champa's very confident in his abilities and is rather indifferent to other
                people dying. At the same time, Champa's shown to be even lazier, often asking Vados to handle matters,
                which he, as a God of Destruction, should handle, for him. He's also shown to be underhanded and he
                cares
                little for rules and order, as he snuck into Universe 7 to collect its portion of the Super Dragon Balls
                set. Even more, he added various modifications in the Tournament of Destroyers to support his fighters.
                Champa tends to carry himself in a less-dignified manner compared to Beerus, as he tends to avoid
                answering questions that incriminate or embarrass him. Unlike Beerus, Champa has not been seen
                behaving in a very polite and sophisticated manner towards others when the time comes, further
                exemplifying his lack of emotional maturity. Champa is also shown to take his rivalry with Beerus
                much more seriously. Even with the looming threat of being erased should he lose the Tournament of
                Power,
                Champa's main goal was to humiliate Beerus.</p>

            <h1>Grand Priest</h1>
            <p>The Grand Priest (大だい神官しんかん, Dai-Shinkan; FUNimation "Grand Minister") is an Angel, who serves the Zen'ō.
                He is also the father of Martinu, Vados, Whis, Marcarita and Kusu.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The Grand Priest, befitting his position and level of strength, is a calm and collected individual. Much
                like his children, he is rather soft-spoken and polite, but has a direct method of speech, and orders
                spoken by him are followed by those below him without question. Unlike the other deities and angels, who
                are mortified by Gokū's casual nature towards the Zen'ō, the Grand Priest is amused at best.

                The Grand Priest appears to have insight into the Zen'ō's thoughts, and can relay his intentions to
                others when the need arises. Perhaps due to his long life and casual demeanor, the Grand Priest is able
                to casually inform the Universes of their impending destruction, showing no remorse for the huge loss of
                life that would also occur.
            </p>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>According to Whis, the Grand Priest has one of the top five battle powers in all of the universes, even
                Whis who is the strongest fighter in the 7th Universe is no match for him.[1] Whis further elaborates
                that the Grand Priest is the strongest being in 'this world', though the context of 'this world' is
                unknown.[2]

                Grand Priest posses some sort of Teleportation, which allows him to transport individuals to his
                location or throughout the Universe.[3]

            <h1>Supreme Kai</h1>
            <p>The Supreme Kais (界かい王おう神しん Kaiōshin, lit. "God of Kings of Worlds", "Deity of Kings of Worlds", or
                "Divine being of Kings of Worlds"), also known as the Creation Gods (創造神 Sōzōshin),[1] are the Core
                People who are naturally born divine and who have the ultimate duty to protect the universe of their
                position. Along with the Gods of Destruction, they are the ruling and overseeing class of the twelve,
                formerly eighteen, universes, and each universe has its own set of gods.
            </p>
            <p>The Supreme Kais possess godly powers and live outside the main universe macrocosm on the Sacred World of
                the Kai. They far outclass the regular Kai as while the lower Kai watch over the living world, the
                Supreme Kais watch over both the Other World and the living world.[2] However, their role is not to
                destroy, and thus they do not have the same strength as the Gods of Destruction.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike the Gods of Destruction and like the Angels they work alongside, they are all members of a
                naturally divine species, though, in their case, they are only divine depending on how they came to be
                in the first place.
            </p>
            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>In Universe 7, the five Supreme Kai ruled over the entire universe 5 Million Before Age, with the Grand
                Supreme Kai overseeing them (the same way that the regular Kai rule over their individual quadrants of
                the living world, with a Grand Kai in charge of the four of them).
            </p>
            <p>They are the Gods of Creation who provide the catalyst for life and planets to be born, as opposed to the
                Gods of Destruction who destroy life and planets, which maintains the balance of the universe. Supreme
                Kai are able to provide the impetus for planets to be born; also, they will sometimes divide up one
                planet and increase the number of planets. They even do things like create life-forms, or transplant
                them from another planet, but their basic job is to watch over the numerous planets.[1] Because the
                number of planets is so very large, the four regular Kai help them out as well.
            </p>
            <p>The Supreme Kais intervene if it appears that the world's balance will crumble, but normally, they merely
                act in an advisory role for new life-forms and do not get involved.[1] The Supreme Kais and the Gods of
                Destruction go to each other's realms and hold a coordination meeting once every millennium.[4] In
                Universe 7, during one of these meetings, held roughly 75 Million Before Age, they got into an argument
                over some trifling thing and the short-tempered God of Destruction Beerus sealed Old Kai away inside the
                Z Sword, as it would not have been proper for him to destroy the Sacred World of the Kais itself.[4]
                They also meet together on other occasions such as working together in protecting the universe from
                major threats in their respective jurisdiction. Eliminating threats is usually the duty under the God of
                Destruction.

                Worlds"), primarily known just as Supreme Kai (界かい王おう神しん Kaiōshin, lit. "God of Kings of Worlds"), is
                the ruler of the eastern area of both the living and the otherworld in the universe and the Supreme Kai
                of Universe 7.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Shin is short, pink-skinned (purple in the anime) with a white mohawk and dressed in a posh Kai outfit.
                He also wears a pair of green Potara earrings (yellow in the anime).
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Shin's attitude changes as the Majin Buu Saga presses forward. When he is first introduced, he squints
                his eyes at Goku and smiles in a manner that makes him seem mysterious and powerful. Just as what a
                supreme leader of the universe should be, he is calm, wise, humble and thinks rationally at critical
                moments. Later on, his constant surprise at the Saiyans power and his dependence on others to protect
                the universe against Majin Buu make him seem more fearful and innocent, most likely due to his previous
                inability to combat those kind of powerful beings himself.

                Although he knows a good amount of information about the universe, he is rather ignorant of some
                important things known by other Kais and Gods of Destruction, due to his lack of full training since the
                elimination of the other Supreme Kais. For example, he was completely unaware of Zeno and who he was, as
                in the Tournament of Destroyers, he asked his ancestor who he was, for which he was slapped on the head
                and informed. Adding onto this, he was unaware of Ultra Instinct, while many of the other Gods of
                Destruction and Supreme Kais were familiar with the ability. Yet another example was his obliviousness
                about the fusing abilities of the Potara, which led to him fusing with Kibito before realizing the
                fusion would be permanent.

                barbels on the sides of his face. He wears Teashade sunglasses, a pair of small white shoes, a black
                tunic with goldenrod-trimmed sleeves, as well as his symbol on the front, and has a pair of cricket-like
                antennae.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>King Kai has a strong sense of humor, so much so that before he can agree to train someone, they have to
                make him laugh, and he tells very bad jokes. He is at least somewhat aware that his jokes are considered
                bad, as when trying to get Goku's attention while trying to telepathically warn him to finish off Frieza
                as the latter was powering up, he threatened that he'll start telling jokes, adding he has a lot of them
                if Goku doesn't respond to him soon, and even came close to carrying out the threat before Goku replied.
                He possesses great intelligence and knowledge about the universe and specializes in universal telepathic
                links. Even though he was already weaker than Vegeta before he taught Goku, King Kai is still a
                veritable library of skills, techniques and literally centuries of wisdom. He is very strategic and
                elaborate when it comes to planning, as evident during the Frieza Saga, organizing (alongside Kami) the
                transfer of all the Namekians and Z Fighters on Namek to Earth before the planet exploded. King Kai is a
                very eccentric mentor, as his methods training in martial arts appear to be very uncommon, such as
                making his student's first two tasks being: catch his pet monkey Bubbles and hitting his butler cricket
                sprite Gregory with a hammer (the latter task only happened in the anime as filler). Despite his odd
                training tactics, he appears to be an effective teacher and is proud of his students' growth. This is
                shown in his delight towards Goku accomplishing the aforementioned tasks, as well his concern towards
                Goku seeking to avenge Krillin by allowing Frieza to power up in full on the dying Planet Namek. These
                qualities display a strong bond between master and disciple, though King Kai did become irritated with
                Goku after he accidentally got him killed by teleporting the exploding Cell to his planet, and much
                later teased the upset Goku by suggesting that Delayed Onset Ki Disorder could prevent him from getting
                stronger.

                King Kai can also be very immature, just like the rest of Kais, as he is seen constantly gloating to the
                other Kais about the strength of his fighters in his quadrant and bickering with them and insulting them
                as if they were brothers and sisters. He does appear to get along with them in some regard, though,
                congregating with them to watch the events of Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn unfold (though possibly only
                because of their shared subordination under the Grand Kai).
